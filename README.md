# 3D-Skull-Reconstruction
Python programs to create the high-resolution geometry for the generation of skull implants 
The main.py can be used to run a pretrained model to create a high-resolution skull model based on a low-resoltion completed model and a high-resolution defective model.
Inputs required for the main.py program:
1.
2.
the output is a completed model in *.mat format.
A complete example is provided, including two example input files and their appearence in JPG for preview.
